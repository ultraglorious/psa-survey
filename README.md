This study surveyed 280 days of ground-based camera data spanning 10 years to determine the probability of occurrence for three types of pulsating aurora.  I developed a tool for manually identifying the start and end times as well as latitudinal boundaries of different types of pulsating aurora events.  These boundaries allowed me to estimate the the location of the the source region of these auroras using a model of Earth's magnetosphere.  The key figures of this paper are included below to illustrate this process.
